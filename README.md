# spodify
iPod player website for Spotify meant to emulate the look of an original iPod classic.
This website is written entirely in base JS with no external imports.

### To run locally
I personally used the `livereload` package from python to develop locally
To install:
  - Pull and navigate to repository directory
  - Run `pip install livereload`
  - Rin `livelreload --port [PORT]`

### TODO
- Fix Queue logic to not be overload
~~- Make scrubing cleaner~~
~~- Add search~~
- Add Playlists menu
~~- Use profile API endpoint to show user data~~
- Add album artwork
